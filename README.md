# React Root Assessment


### How to set up and run the code
Simply visit this sandbox link: https://sldton.csb.app/ . To view the code, click on the "Open Sandbox" button (see bottom right of the page)

### Briefly explain how you approached the problem
- I was mostly concerned about getting the Grid right from a CSS perspective as I believed that would be the tricky part.
- The above seemed rather not as complex, thus I had some time to focus on the Logic.
- Unfortunately the API URL was not working, and this set me off (rythym wise) a bit, i.e I could not continue, thus had to come out of the Zone. Honestly, my plan was to smash this right away.
- Once I could hit the API to get data, my next concern was programmatically matching the returned data to the Grid I drew. The data has a set of 30 items, while I am working with a 16 by 23 grid.
- I analysed the response data to see what I would need to look up in order to correctly set and display the various status colours and Icon. This turned our trickier since I could not (unfortunately) fully understand the expectation from the spec vs the data itself. For instance, there is an instruction to determine which zones at time of viewing need maintenance. From the data returned, I personally expected something clearer, i.e `"maintain": true` or something similar - but i guess that is where the trick lies.

### What you would do differently if you had to do it again
- Perhaps I would ignore the time aspect. Although there was no time constraint per se, the fact that there was a range mentioned made me feel that I need to be as quick to get to the solution as possible and ensure that I produce something good within the mentioned (suggested) time range.
- I would have spent more time analysing the response data to probably understand the relationship it has with the expectations, i.e the data structure issue I mentioned in the previous section - see last point.
- Separate the HTML segments into different files (components)

### What you learned during the project
- Programming done in a rush is hard to yield good results, thus time thinking is as valuable if not more, as the time one will eventually spend writing out the solution.
- Dinos aren't that easy to program about, we should try puppies  - hahaha!

### How you think we can improve this challenge
- Much elaborate instructions.
- Perhaps some examples that explain the relationship between the data fields from the response object to what the developer is meant to build. I do believe, however, that in the real world, this would be a minor issue as I would have simply Slacked or messages a co-worker to better understand the spec.
- Maybe avoid mentioning the time aspect and rather set a due date, that way, the dev does not have to chase something mentioned merely arbitrarily?


THANK YOU for the opportunity to do this, Root!
